"""
Example: a Strands agent protected at all four legs by one hook provider.

The agent is ordinary Strands code. Adding security is one constructor argument:
`hooks=[AIGuardHooks(...)]`. From then on every model call and every tool
call the agent loop makes is scanned -- the prompt and response by the
model-call events, and each tool's input and output as first-class tool_events
by the tool-call events. (`Agent.structured_output()` runs outside that loop and
is not covered; see the Limitations section of the README.)

Enforcement follows what each Strands event permits (a framework capability
boundary, not a choice):
  * a blocked prompt is cancelled (the model is not called);
  * a blocked tool input is cancelled;
  * a poisoned or leaking tool OUTPUT is replaced with a safe error result;
  * a blocked model RESPONSE can only be retried, then fails closed -- Strands
    does not permit substituting a model response.
