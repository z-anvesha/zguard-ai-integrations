"""
Example: a Converse-API chat loop where every call is scanned.

The application code is a completely ordinary Bedrock chat client. The single
protect_client() line is the whole integration: after it, every Converse call
through this client -- including ones a framework would make internally --
has its prompt scanned before the request is signed or sent, and its response
scanned before this code sees it.

A blocked prompt raises AIGuardBlocked without the request ever leaving
the process: nothing is signed, nothing is sent, nothing is billed.
